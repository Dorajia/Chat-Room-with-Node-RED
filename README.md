This is a mini project of CMPE 272 course. In this project, we creat a Chat Room application based on the IBM tutorial. http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cloud/library/cl-rtchat-app/
New features added:
1) The language translation function in the chat room: users can translate the message before sending it. It will help users from different countries to communicate fluently.
2) Cloudant DB to store the conversation history, so users are able to track the history after reconnecting to the chat room.
